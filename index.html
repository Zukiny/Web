        <p>The first computer was invented by Charles Babbage (1822) but was not built until 1991. The first computer was conceived as a machine of cogs and gears but only became practical in the 1950s and 60s with the invention of semi-conductors. In the 1970s, a hardware company called IBM emerged as the computing leader. In the 1980s, however, software became increasingly important, and by the 1990s a software company called Microsof had become the computing frontline leader by giving ordinary people tools like word-processing. During the 1990s computing became more personal, until the World-Wide-Web turned Internet URLs into web site names that people could read. A company called Google then offered the ultimate personal service, free access to the vast public library we call the Internet, and soon everyone's gateway to the web was the new computing leader. In the 2000s computing evolved yet again, to become a social medium as well as a personal tool.</p>

        <p>Developed by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC, was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. Described by the university as the “first general-purpose electronic computer,” ENIAC’s “operational characteristics” included memory and arithmetic.</p>

        <p>With typical flamboyance, a bow-tie wearing Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh in January 1984. With Vangelis’ “Chariots of Fire” playing in the background, the Apple co-founder showcased a number of the Macintosh’s capabilities, from its ability to “talk” to a drawing application that was able to produce sophisticated images.</p>

        <h2>influential figures in the Evolution of Computing</h2>
        <h3>Charles Babbage</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: Top;">
        <img src="Images\Charles.png" alt="Charles Babbage - Polymath and mathematician" style="margin-right: 10px;" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Known for being the first to come up with an automatic calculator, Charles Babbage was a mathematician in Victorian England. He created plans to build the Analytical Engine, a machine that contained some aspects of modern computers.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: Top;">
        <img src="Images\Ada.png" alt="Ada Lovelace - Mathematician and writer" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Ada Lovelace is known as the first programmer in history. She was the daughter of poet Lord Byron and a good friend of Babbage. Having found interest in his ideas, Ada took to writing algorithms to be used on a machine.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Alan Turing</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: Top;">
        <img src="Images\Alan.png" alt="Alan Turing - Mathematician and computer scientist" width="200" height="280">
        <p>During World War II, the Germans had invented the enigma machine to encrypt messages. Alan Turing led a team to cracking many of these messages and, in turn, saved many lives. He is now considered contributing to the modern computer with his contributions to the field. Turing is also remembered for his theories on artificial intelligence that are still studied today. The Turing test is his most prominent idea, as it looks at whether a computer can mimic human behavior independently and fool people.</p>
    </div>
        <h3>Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: Top;">
        <img src="Images\Tim.png" alt="Ada Lovelace - Mathematician and writer" style="margin-right: 10px;" width="200" height="280">
        <p>He invented the World Wide Web, a system of pulling up web pages for websites. Whenever you type in “www.” you are searching for a site on the World Wide Web. While many advancements have come about since then, Tim Berners-Lee’s contributions are still the building blocks of the internet.</p>

        <h3>The impact of computing on society</h3>
        <p>
            <b>COMPUTER USES IN SCIENCE AND FIELDS:</b>
            Scientists utilise computers to create hypotheses, gather, examine, and test data, as well as to electronically communicate with colleagues worldwide. Robust computing systems can produce comprehensive analyses of the effects of earthquakes on structures and pollution on the weather. Applications for satellite-based science would not have been feasible without computers. Computers are utilised as a research tool.
        </p> 

        <p> 
            <b>COMPUTER USES IN EDUCATORIAL FIELDS:</b>
            These days, almost all institutions, universities, and schools place an increased focus on computer education and include it into their curricula. These institutions now teach additional disciplines using computers in addition to providing computer education exclusively. Computers are being used effectively in classrooms and libraries to make learning much more engaging. Computer-based training programs and computer-aided education are making learning far more engaging than recorded television presentations.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>COMPUTERS' APPLICATIONS IN COMMUNICATION:</b>
            Computers are used to facilitate the sending of messages from one location to another through electronic mail. Email makes it easier for one individual to communicate with multiple others via phone and computer. Each user or person in this system has a mail box, which they can access by entering their account number and password on workstations or terminals within the system. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>COMPUTERS' USES IN THE ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING FIELDS:</b>
            Engineers and architects utilise computers a lot for design and drawing. Three-dimensional things can be created by computers. Architects can tour houses that have been designed but not built by utilising technologies such as virtual reality. Computer-aided design is a technique used by designers of automobiles, aircraft, ships, and aerospace to create a variety of vehicles. Robots with computers are used in manufacturing facilities to carry out dangerous tasks. Moreover, the product's design and planning can be done via computer-aided manufacturing.
